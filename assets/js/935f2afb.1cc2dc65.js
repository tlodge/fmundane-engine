They allow us to attach variables to our experience scripts that will be evaluated at runtime.  The purpose is, for example to create an experience that has a few places in it that can be changed just before or even while an experience is running.  Examples include getting a voice to say something personal to a user (such as their name or address), or showing an image that has recently been taken (or provided by a participant).

Click on the browser in the Lenvo, open a tab and go to 127.0.0.1:3001. If you see something then the problem is with your machine and the network (or perhaps the browser \u2013 maybe try a different browser). If you do not see anything then the server software is not running (unlikely as we have not seen this before).
