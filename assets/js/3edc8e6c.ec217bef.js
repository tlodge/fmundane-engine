When the Lenovo boots up, it assigns addresses to the devices connected to its USB ports. However (probably dependent on what device it discovers first), it sometimes gives the arm address /dev/ttyUSB0 and at other times it gives it /dev/ttyUSB1. I'm not entirely convinced that it won't use numbers higher than this too. The fix has just been to write the robot arm commands to both outputs in parallel, so that it will work for the one that is connected and be disregarded by the other. Clearly this is not ideal. Instead the system should interrogate the port info, find out which one the arm is connected to and use that. Should be easy enough using a few linux system commands. Another option is to try and query the arm on various ports and if you get a response on one then you know it is the correct port.
